# Forming-Magic-Square
A python program that builds Magic Squares, the program allows the user to enter (N) through standard input, where (N) is any 
positive odd integer, Check that (N) is valid and prompt the user to enter another value for N if it is not,
Calculate a valid magic square for that value of (N), Print out the magic square legibly, 
Verify that the magic square is indeed valid, Print “correct” if the verification step passes.
